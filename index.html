          <p>This society tries to incorporate many different activities,
          allowing people to try and experience a whole variety of
          different things. We enjoy climbing (indoor and out), hiking,
          caving ghyll scrambling, and pretty much anything outdoorsy!
          You don't even need to have had <strong>any</strong> experience
          doing any of these to have a go.

                  <h3>Climbing</h3>
                </header>
                <span>A huge part of this society is the climbing. We have
                  several very experienced indoor and outdoor climbers. As
                  well as frequent weekend trips away to the Lake District,
                  Peak District, Yorkshire Dales, North Wales and more (giving
                  us lots of outdoor climbing opportunities), we also run
                  weekly trips to Warwick University's indoor climbing
                  centre.

                  <h3>Hiking</h3>
                </header>
                <span>Another favourite in this society is hiking. Most weekend
                  trips away will offer hiking of some description, from
                  gentle strolls with lunch at the pub, to full days, scaling
                  epic mountains. We have also had workshop walks, learning
                  navigational skills along the way, run by experienced
                  outdoor experts.</span>

                  <h3>Ghyll Scrambling</h3>
                </header>
                <span>
                  If you're after something a little more extreme, you may want
                  to give ghyll scrambling a go. This involves getting a wetsuit
                  on, and making your way up a river. It involves swimming,
                  climbing, jumping and provides enormous fun. Trips to the Lake
                  District and Wales will often have good opportunities for this
                  activity, although you will need your own wetsuit!

										<h3>Caving</h3>
									</header>
                  <span>
                    Caving is a slightly different taste. It involves the safe
                    exploration and navigation of natural caves. This means
                    being underground, often soaked, with no natural light, and
                    some friends to share the fantastic experience. If you have
                    never been before, we highly recommend giving it a go!

                <span>
                  We also have a thriving social side to the society, with
                  regular weekly meets at Whitefriars pub, as well as more
                  arranged events and activities in which to partake in
                  Coventry. Even if you're not interested in coming on trips
                  with us, there's still plenty for you to get involved in with
                  us!
