          <p>This society tries to incorporate many different activities,
          allowing people to try and experience a whole variety of
          different things. We enjoy climbing (indoor and out), hiking,
          caving ghyll scrambling, and pretty much anything outdoorsy!</p>

                  <h3>Climbing</h3>
                </header>
                <span>A huge part of this society is the climbing. We have
                  several very experienced indoor and outdoor climbers. As
                  well as frequent weekend trips away to the Lake District,
                  Peak District, Yorkshire Dales, North Wales and more (giving
                  us lots of outdoor climbing opportunities), we also run
                  weekly trips to Warwick University's indoor climbing
                  centre.

                  <h3>Hiking</h3>
                </header>
                <p>Another favourite in this society is hiking. Most weekend
                  trips away will offer hiking of some description, from
                  gentle strolls with lunch at the pub, to full days, scaling
                  epic mountains. We have also had workshop walks, learning
                  navigational skills along the way, run by experienced
                  outdoor experts.</p>

                <p>Fancy jumping into a freezing cold river and then climbing
                  up it? Sounds like ghyll scrambling is for you. There are
                  opportunities away on weekend trips to try ghyll scrambling,
                  but you'll need your own wet suit, learn more over on the

										<h3>Caving</h3>
									</header>
                  <p>If being in total darkness, crawling through mud and water,
                    squeezing through tiny passageways appeals, then you should
                    definitely give caving a go. We have several experienced
                    cavers, and whenever possible throw ourselves underground.
                    There's nothing quite like it as an experience, we cannot
                    recommend it enough!</p>
