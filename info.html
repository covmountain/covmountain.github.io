    <section class="wrapper style4 container">
      <h2>Membership</h2>
      <p>
        To become a member of the Coventry University Mountaineering Society, we
        charge <strong>£30</strong> a year. This covers your BMC (British
        Mountaineering Council) membership, including insurance, and insurance
        with the Students Union. It will also allow you to use any of the clubs
        equipment whenever you need it. You <strong>must</strong> become a
        member before we can take you on any trips at all.
      </p>
      <h2>Sessions at Warwick</h2>
      <img src='images/warwick.jpg'>
      <p>
        Every Wednesday afternoon at <strong>13:30</strong>, we go climbing at the sports centre at Warwick
        University. This allows us to climb very regularly, with bouldering also
        available. To get to the wall, we use the bus service, which charge
        <strong>£4</strong>
        for a return journey, this must be brought in exact change to comply
        with the bus's payment system. Once at the wall, you can choose to
        either pay for a membership there, or pay on one-off sessions. For
        students, these one-off sessions are <strong>£5.50</strong> - but subject to change
        regularly. You can also hire rock shoes there, and the club provide
        harness's. Climbing here is not limited to Wednesday, and many members
        like to go more frequently throughout the week, so there is often
        somebody there.
      </p>
      <h2>Ballroom Bouldering</h2>
      <p>
        There is now the opportunity to boulder at the newly opened Ballroom bouldering
        centre in Coventry.

      </p>
      <h2>Trips</h2>
      <p>
        We run trips all over the country, and some abroad. These trips usually
        have a fixed price of <strong>£30</strong> for club members, the exception
        being for day trips, or trips involving qualifications, or trips longer
        than a weekend,  which can often cost more.
