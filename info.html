      <h2>Indoor climbing - Warwick sport (Bear Rock)</h2>
      <img src="images/warwick.jpg">
      <p>
        Every Wednesday afternoon at <strong>13:30</strong>, we go climbing at Warwick University sports centre. 
        This centre allows us to rope climb very regularly and teach new climbers the necessary skills before venturing outdoors. 
        We travel to the climbing centre using the bus service, which charges £4 for a return journey, this needs to be in exact change or can be paid via the NX Bus mTicket app. 
        Once at the climbing centre student entry costs <strong>£5:50 (make sure you have your university id).</strong>
        <br><br>
        The club will provide harnesses and belay devices. Climbing shoes can be hired at the centre.
        <br><br>
        Location: University of Warwick, University Rd, Coventry, CV4 7AL
      </p>
      <h2>The Ballroom Climbing Wall</h2>
      <p>
        Every Monday evening at 17:15, we go bouldering at the Ballroom in Coventry city centre. The Ballroom is a 6-minute walk from the Hub which makes it a great place to visit regularly. 
        On a Monday, Coventry University Mountaineering students get a discounted price of £6 (which includes £6.50 entry, £3 shoe hire and the £3 one off registration fee).

      <h2>Trips</h2>
      <p>
        We run trips all over the country, and some abroad. These trips usually
        have a fixed price of <strong>£30</strong> for club members, the exception
        being for day trips, or trips involving qualifications, or trips longer
        than a weekend,  which can often cost more.
