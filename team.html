            After enjoying a great year as Gear Officer last year, I am now
            acting as club treasurer, alongside working for UTC on placement.
            Thoroughly looking forward to another year adventuring!

            Mountaineering has always been a part of my life. As a child I was 
            marched up mountains against my will with only the promise of chocolate 
            keeping me walking. However since joining the society in my first 
            year I have had nothing but enthusiasm for mountaineering. As social 
            sec it is my responsibility to ensure a happy and thriving club.

            Alongside studying for a degree in Aerospace Engineering, I have taken an
            active interest in the Mountaineering society - and now as a member of the committee
            ensuring the safety and suitable use of the equipment we use.
