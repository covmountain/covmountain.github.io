            I stumbled across this society last September and soon became addicted to all things climbing and had an amazing time with CUMS. 
            I’m looking forward to another year of the epic trips we’ve planned!

            I've tried most things outdoorsy, with my favourites being mountain biking and skiing. 
            I had never really got into climbing until I joined CUMS; which soon shot mountaineering into the limelight. 
            From there I have progressed into a mini-adventure (5ft 7in) and thus opted for a role in the exec to help fulfil other people’s passions for the great outdoors.

            I'm an experienced hiker, having hiked throughout most of the UK, but I was only introduced to climbing through CUMS and I’ve fallen in love with it. 
            I'm looking to pass on the enjoyment that I have experienced so far to new members of the society whether experienced or brand new to the sport of climbing, 
            hiking, or anything else we do!

            I haven't been climbing all that long and honestly am not that good, 
            but as Social Secretary my main responsibility is to have fun and interact 
            with others which I certainly am experienced with. Feel free to approach me any time 
            (I feel I should mention I don't bite), and make sure to look out for me in my natural habitat, 
            The Pub.

              I’ve been climbing for as long as I can remember and last year this society fueled my addiction for all things climbing. 
              Which is why I chose to join the exec to continue my addiction and help encourage others, passing down my knowledge 
              and the knowledge of other members in the society.
