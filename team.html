            Growing up in the Lake District, I have been fortunate to experience
            the beauty of the natural world my entire life. Aside from
            mountaineering, I am studying for a degree in Computer Science, and am
            a keen guitarist and pianist.

          <p class='bio'>
            My interest in mountaineering started in fresher’s week when I impulsively 
            signed up to the bar crawl and further the taster trips, since then I have 
            been to France, Spain and all around the UK and I haven’t looked back once.

            My job is to look after the finances of the club. I am a life-long
            mountaineer, which allows me to enjoy another of my hobbies in
            photography.

            I'm here to bring you the fun, which makes my job super easy because 
            since signing up for mountaineering last year there hasn't been a single 
            dull moment, and this year were going to turn it up to 11!

          <p class='bio'>
            I will be working with Izzie to provide the fun in the club.
            Socially, we are very active, and always have plenty for members to
            be doing. Alongside the society, I'm studying for a degree in
            Computer Science.

            I deal with all of the club gear, making sure we have enough, and
            that it's all safe. As well as being on the committee in the club, I
            am also studying Engineering.
